# Digital Signage Template Task

Our client would like a new HTML template created.  They have provided a design 
and some asset files.

![Template Design](design.jpg)

The assets folder should contain everything you need to produce the HTML template.
You are free to use any tools and libraries you like.

So that the message can be changed without having to alter the HTML file you will
need to load the content from the data.json file in the assets folder.

Any questions, let me know!
